This Python package provides numerical routines for graph flow analysis, particularly:

* PageRank
* Linear System of Resistance
* Non-linear System of Resistance
* HITS (Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search)

# Installation

You must have `numpy` pre-installed. GCC and GFORTRAN compilers have to be available in the machine.
After ensuring they have been installed, type the following to install `graphflow`:

```
>>> pip install -U graphflow
```
